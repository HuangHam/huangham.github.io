Exploration choices have been well characterized in nonsocial contexts, however, choices to explore (or not) in social environments are less well understood. Social environments are of particular interest because a key factor that increases exploration in nonsocial contexts is environmental uncertainty, and the social world is generally appreciated to be highly uncertain. Although uncertainty sometimes must be reduced behaviorally (e.g., by trying something and seeing what happens), other times it may be reduced cognitively (e.g., by imagining possible outcomes). Across 4 experiments, participants searched for rewards in a series of grids that were either described as comprising real people distributing previously-earned points (social context) or as the result of a computer algorithm or natural phenomenon (nonsocial context). In Experiments 1 and 2, participants explored more, and earned fewer rewards, in the social versus nonsocial context, suggesting that social uncertainty prompted behavioral exploration at the cost of task-relevant goals. In Experiments 3 and 4, we provided additional information about the people in the search space that could support social cognitive approaches to uncertainty reduction, including relationships of the social agents distributing points (Experiment 3) and information relevant to social group membership (Experiment 4); exploration decreased in both instances. Taken together, these experiments highlight the approaches to, and tradeoffs of, uncertainty reduction in social contexts.","tags":null,"title":"When uncertainty in social contexts increases exploration and decreases obtained rewards (In Press)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ham, H","Jenkins, A.

How does social context affect the speed and fidelity with which people learn the likely consequences of their actions? Here, we integrate approaches from instrumental learning and social decision-making to investigate how reward distributions (across oneself and another person) and others’ identity (with whom rewards are shared) influence how people learn about rewards. Methods:We recruited 94 online participants to perform a computerized instrumental learning task in which the monetary rewards obtained on each trial would ostensibly be split between themselves and another person (e.g., “Nurse”; “Lawyer”). On each trial in a block, one of five possible images appeared on the screen, along with information about how the reward would be split (e.g., you:30%; Nurse:70%); participants were obliged to quickly press 1 of 3 keys, which yielded either $0, $1, or $2 (before splitting). We varied the split percentage to create either disadvantageous inequality (participant gets the smaller share) or advantageous inequality on each trial. Following the task, subjects rated the warmth and competence of each partner. We embodied two hypotheses into computational models. The naive reinforcement learning (Naive) model assumes the mind represents only the total, objective reward. The social perception reinforcement learning model (SPRL) assumes that monetary inequity and social perception dynamically shape value representations during learning. Results:Mixed-effect linear regressions with subject ID as the random intercept revealed that people learn faster when they gain a larger share of the reward, indicating an effect of inequity on learning (p = 0.02). Regression further showed that the effect of both inequity and social perception is stronger in the later stage of learning (ps \u003c 0.05). Critically, we then compared our computational models using WAIC and discovered that SPRL outperformed Naive. Further, we saw SPRL outperformed more in the disadvantageous inequity condition (p \u003c 0.01), suggesting that the social context has a larger effect on learning when subjects obtain a smaller share of rewards. Conclusion:These results suggest inequality and social perception information influence reward-based learning. These effects are especially prominent in the later stage of learning and when subjects suffer disadvantageous inequity.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of social context on reward-based learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ham, H","Grahek, I","Bustamante, L","Daw, N","Caplin, A","Musslick, S"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1656979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656979200,"objectID":"536d11381acfecfd9b0e6609ea7213cf","permalink":"https://HuangHam.github.io/publication/psychometric/","publishdate":"2022-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/psychometric/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent years have witnessed significant advances in our under-standing of bounds on rationality in both cognitive psychologyand economics.  These two fields have been making separateprogress, but time is ripe for unifying these efforts.  In this ar-ticle, we introduce recently developed economic tools, them-selves rooted in the psychometric tradition,  to quantify indi-vidual differences in the capacity for cognitive control.  Thesetools suggest that a reliable assessment of the capacity for cog-nitive control may be accomplished by examining task perfor-mance as a function of reward.  We demonstrate through simulation studies that an incentive-informed measure of task per-formance does a better job of recovering individual differencesin one’s capacity for cognitive control, compared to the commonly used congruency effect. Furthermore, we show that theeconomic approach can be used to predict control-dependentbehavior across different task settings. We conclude by discussing future directions for the fruitful integration of behav-ioral economics and cognitive psychology with the aim of im-proved measurement of individual differences in the capacityfor cognitive control.","tags":null,"title":"Leveraging psychometrics of rational inattention to estimate individual differences in the capacity for cognitive control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ham, H","Cedegao, Z","Holliday, W.

Recent research has begun to unmask connections between these two systems, proposing roles for attention and working memory in shaping underlying learning computations. Here, using a simple instrumental learning task, we provide evidence that working memory plays a role in establishing the correct state space that reinforcement learning operates over. We show that reinforcement learning is impaired when executive functioning is taxed by a secondary task and that this effect is especially pronounced when the two tasks are performed simultaneously rather than alternated. Computational modeling suggests that when the executive function is occupied, the reinforcement learning system forms policy over a confused state-space. This study adds to a growing body of research proposing a  more fundamental role for high-level executive processes in low-level reinforcement learning computations.","tags":null,"title":"Working Memory Shapes State-Space for Policy Formation in Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"}]
